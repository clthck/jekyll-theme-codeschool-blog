Our upcoming [Django course][], Try Django, has us following the sepia-toned journeys of the folks making their way out West in the mid-1800s, hoping to strike it rich.
In this California Gold Rush-themed course, you’ll see lots of mountains, trees, prospectors, and covered wagons as you venture into Django and track the treasures you find along the way.

When I set out to design this course, I gathered a lot of inspiration from the iconic imagery connected to the Gold Rush era. (The timing especially worked out for me, too, since I’ve been on a scenery kick lately.) To bring these scenes to life, I used a combination of Adobe Illustrator to make the vector shapes, and then transferred everything into Photoshop to add texture and light effects.

## Setting Up the Scene
First, I drew some hills.

In this mountainous scene, I knew upfront I wanted a river cutting through mountains — mainly so I could have a believable gold panner somewhere in the picture to really give the image context, rather than it just being mountains. I drew two hills and then subsequent hills around it to establish a true foreground, middle ground, and background.

Notice that the highest mountains are not the farthest back. Think about a horizon line and perspective. The farther back the mountains are, the lower they would look in comparison to the mountains closest to you.

Then I made a gradient of browns to work with. The color of the gradient scale isn’t that important, as colors and levels are going to be adjusted at the end. However, it is important to have a set scale of colors to show the different levels of the scenery.

Next, I applied the colors. I made the hills closest to front the darkest, and the river is a light value to make it stand out as a different element. Later in this process, I’ll add 
texture to really emphasize this difference in material.

## Tree Time!
Here’s a secret: I only made silhouettes for four trees. Specifically, these four trees:

I placed them in the mountainous composition like so:

Then, I took the same four tree shapes and copied, scaled, flipped, and repositioned them to cover all of the mountains:

When working with silhouettes, it’s really easy to get a natural effect when duplicating shapes. If you make sure there are no obvious patterns, there is no need to make every element unique. Take shortcuts where you can and make life a little easier on yourself!

## Photoshopping
Next, I brought the vector image into Photoshop. When my raster elements are going to be super detailed, sometimes I paste in my vector shapes on different layers so I can work with everything separately. This time I didn’t bother, because I added pretty basic texture and dimension on the mountains and trees.

Also note, that this effect would have been much harder to get if I didn’t have a Cintiq, iPad, or some other drawing tablet to use. To get something to really look like a painting, it’s important to have a tool that recognizes pressure sensitivity. Some illustrators choose to make their own brushes, but I made the one-time purchase of [Kyle’s Ultimate Megapack][] of Photoshop brushes, and that has served me very well. I used a few of the oil brushes in this particular piece.

### Photoshop Step 1: Texturing
I worked my way through the composition, adding highlights and lowlights with the “oil” brushes to the hills and trees. I worked it just enough to convey that this is not a flat image on the screen. Light will catch rocks and tree branches, adding dimension and texture to the objects and layers on screen. I wish I had a better way to describe this step, but it comes down to lots of practice and trusting your eye.

I changed my highlight and shadow colors as I moved throughout the piece. Not all shadows are going to be as bright and distinct as others, especially as objects get farther away in the distance. I usually chose from the set palette I made at the beginning, choosing shades one step up and tints one below the object I was painting at that moment.

I’ve isolated my detailing on the hill and trees in the right mid-ground. You can see how the subtle details make a big difference. My goal isn’t to make individual leaves or rocks, but to give the visual illusion of a bunch of leaves and rocks together.

Basically, I scribbled in a controlled way. I kept my light source in mind, thought about the highlights and shadows that light source would make, and scribbled there.

Here is what the image looks like after I’ve done a similar treatment to the other hills, trees, water, and sky:

### Photoshop Step 2: Effects
Almost done! Next, I overlayed some additional textures and effects.

I added a layer and brought down my saturation slightly. This keeps a variation in tones, but takes out some of the color. I also added a vignette to make it feel like you are looking through a hole back in time, as well as a layer of canvas (found in the same brush pack) on top. Here is the difference with said effects:

For the final touch, I added a layer that is actually a high-res photo of crinkled, old paper. I set it as Overlay and dropped the opacity so it looks like part of the composition and makes the whole image look aged and authentic.

Here is the final-final image, after I added the main title of the course and the old prospector I created in a separate file:
